IMPORTANT!!!

In order to use the gcalsync plugin, you must install the ZendGdata PHP library.


1) Down the latest release of the ZendGdata package from:

http://framework.zend.com/download/gdata

2) Extract the content of the download, which includes a lot of examples and docs you don't need.

3) upload just the ./library/Zend folder to the main Joomla ./libraries folder, so you now have a ...

/path/to/your/joomla/libraries/Zend

... which should contains subfolders like Gdata, Http, etc.

That's it.  You can now use this plugin.
